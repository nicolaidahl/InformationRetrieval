- Talk about hyphens and how we should exclude them


Explain your inverted index implementation. As part of your explanation you need to clearly describe how you:
• gather term information while your index program is parsing the collection
• tokenise terms, including how you deal with punctuation and markup tags, and
handle acronyms and hyphenated words
• merge the information together for the final lexicon and invlists files
This explanation should be around a page in length, but no longer than one and a half pages.

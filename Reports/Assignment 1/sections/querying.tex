\section{Querying}
\label{sec:querying}

Explain your index search implementation. As part of your explanation you need to clearly describe:
• the data structures you used for your lexicon when it is held in memory
• how you look up corresponding term occurrence information in your invlists file
This explanation should be around a page in length, but no longer than one and a half pages.



How large is your inverted index? How does this compare with the size of the original collection? Why is it larger/smaller than the original collection?

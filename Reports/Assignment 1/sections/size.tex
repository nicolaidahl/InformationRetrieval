\section{Index Size}
\label{sec:indexsize}

When indexing the sample latimes collection, our final inverted index (including the lexicon, inverted list and document ID map files) with stopwords removed is approximately 176MB, where the original collection is approximately 476MB.

\paragraph{}
This is due to several factors:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The original latimes collection includes markup tags and extra metadata about each document, which we discard.
	\item We remove stopwords from the collection.
	\item Where each term in the collection requires disk space for an entire ASCII representation of each occurrence of a term, our inverted list simply requires space for the byte representation of two integers for each document in which a term occurs. Although in the worst case, in which a term occurs only once in a single document, this in fact occupies more space on disk, in the vast majority of cases there is a significant space saving.
\end{enumerate}

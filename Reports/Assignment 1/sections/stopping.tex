\section{Stopping}
\label{sec:stopping}

The stopping as well as the indexing module have been implemented using the delegation design pattern. The stopper module's sole responsibility is to check if a word passed to it is in the stoplist that was provided\,\cite{princeton}.

To perform constant-time lookups in the stoplist we used the standard Java HashSet of strings. We utilize the standard Java string hash function for an even distribution of keys between the buckets\,\cite{javamex}.
